# ATM

- The purpose of this project is to garner a larger understanding of using arrays, inheritance, user input, and objects in ruby by creating a program that will run an ATM to interact with users

### Setup
First, you will need to pull the ATM repository
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/awesomo98/ATM.git
```
Then, open up the folder and subsequent files
```sh
    $ cd ATM
    $ subl .
```
### Questions

- I am still not entirely comfortable with calling .csv files.

```ruby
    file = File.open("Accounts.csv", 'r')
```
    What does the 'r' do, and how can I identify exactly what I want to call inside my file?
    
- Why do I get so many undefined method errors all the time?

- How do you check the pin?
